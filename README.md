Learning! Code more, test more and learn more.  
This folder contains some test codes. Some of them are my test on online judges, and some are just the test for the new algorithm.

    Change to another lab, but still coding. Keep going!

    Repeated course, so sad!

1. water
    * soj1020  
        big integer division
    * soj1021  
        stack
    * soj1035  
    * soj1051  
    * soj1198  
        using strcpy, strcat, strcmp  
2. soj1046
    * be careful for the long description  
        (number of quarters, number of periods that would be returned, minimum quarters)
    * you can regard it as the first n maximum numbers selection, using the heap.  
        maybe faster than selecting after sorting
    * the orderly insert is better than the max n numbers selection by travel the array  
        just hold the limited size of the front n numbers  
3. soj1176
    * abs() is in stdlib.h, not math.h
    * recursive function would be TLE, just mark down the state is OK
4. waiting...
